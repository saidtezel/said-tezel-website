title: Hourly Ad Schedule Management Script for Google Ads
---

I have been using and admiring the powerful scripting features provided on Google Ads. It truly gives you a better control over your ad campaigns instead of trying to fiddle through Google Ads' god-awful redesign.

Out of a recent necessity, I've come across the challenge of creating a script that provides selective control over select MCC accounts and ad campaigns. Upon some research, I've stumbled upon [brainlabsdigital.com](http://brainlabsdigital.com/), who have been creating some great scripts for managing Google Ads accounts.

Even though they already have a well-functioning script for day parting, I had to make some adjustments in how the script functions to satisfy my requirements. The final result is this script, which is my first attempt at properly writing/customising ad scripts. The script is a heavily customised version of what they have created. The three main changes in this script are:

- It can be used to manage your all MCC (Ads Manager) accounts with a limit of up to 50 accounts. Perfect for ad agencies!
- Instead of applying the bidding schedules across all the campaigns in an ad account, it instead utilises a label-based approach to provide you with the flexibility to adjust scheduling for your select ad campaigns.
- It gives you to ability to enable/disable mobile bid adjustments based on your choice.

## What It Does

Currently, Google Ads already provides the option to set up bid adjustment schedules. However you can only set up schedules in 4-hour intervals, which can prevent you from having a more granular method of changing the bid schedules.

This script is the perfect solution for setting up hourly adjustments to your bidding schedule, across many campaigns and even ad accounts under your MCC. Everything is label based; so you can easily create a bidding schedule that applies to ad campaigns of your choice.

You can create multiple strategies and apply them across different campaigns in different ad accounts simply by utilising the labels on Google Ads. It also gives you the ability to combine account level bidding strategies with mobile bid adjustments to give you even more power with controlling your campaigns.

## How It Works

A Google Sheet document will keep track of all the individual ad bidding schedules and automatically apply them to their respective campaigns. You can find and copy the template [sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XuV-f-gYDmRWV2TZLvPjWM9VRT6qR3gg-c57HIsnT64/edit#gid=1936597092).

You can find the full script at the bottom of this page. Once you copy/paste the script in your Google Ads interface, you will need to replace the `spreadsheetUrl` variable in the script with the full URL of the Google sheet you've just duplicated.

1. You will need to create and apply a label called `dayPartingEnabled` to each MCC account you would like to schedule bids for. The script supports up to 50 ad accounts. Remember, the ad schedule will only work across the ad accounts with that label.
2. To create a new schedule, make a duplicate of the `template` sheet. Do not make any changes on the template sheet.
3. Rename the duplicate sheet to something distinguishable, without using any special characters or spaces. You will use the sheet name when applying labels to campaigns later.
4. Each sheet consists of three separate tables (blue, green and purple).
5. For setting up campaign-level bid adjustments, fill in the schedule on the BLUE sheet accordingly.
6. If you'd like to add mobile bid adjustments, fill in the schedule on the GREEN sheet as well.
7. If you want mobile bid adjustments, you will also need to rename the sheet with the `_incMobile` suffix. For example, a sheet named `dayParting` will not apply mobile bid adjustments; whereas a sheet named `dayParting_incMobile` will.
8. Once you have completed filling in the ad schedule, you will need to create a new campaign-level label on Google Ads. The name of the label needs to precisely match the name of the sheet you have created here.
9. Apply the new label across all the ad campaigns you'd like to run a specific ad scheduling for.
10. Test and preview the changes the script makes. The total number of accounts and total number of ad campaigns processed by the script should be output in console.
11. Set up scheduling for the script you've just created to run every hour.
12. Celebrate saving time with a cup of tea!

* Campaign label based ad scheduling
*
* This script is a heavily modified version of the day parting script provided by brainlabsdigital.com
* It provides an MCC version of the script that heavily depeneds on the labels applied to the campaigns.
*
* It will apply ad schedules to campaigns or shopping campaigns and set
* the ad schedule bid modifier and mobile bid modifier at each hour according to
* multiplier timetables in a Google sheet.
*
* This version creates schedules with modifiers for 4 hours, then fills the rest
* of the day and the other days of the week with schedules with no modifier as a
* fail safe.
*
* Version: 1
* Updated to allow -100% bids, change mobile adjustments and create fail safes.
